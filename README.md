### TODO
#### PHASE 1 - basic required features [API]
- [ ] Create model for map points
- [ ] Create types for map points and requests and responses
- [ ] Mock data for map points
- [ ] Create API for map points clustering with K-Means or SuperCluster based on scale
#### PHASE 2 - optional features [UI and Validation]
- [ ] Make tests for API
- [ ] Validate input data and manage errors
- [ ] Create UI for map points clustering, using Leaflet
- [ ] Zoom in/out to see the difference
