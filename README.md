### TODO
#### PHASE 1 - basic required features [API]

- [ ] Create API for map points clustering with K-Means
#### PHASE 2 - optional features [UI and Validation]
- [ ] Make tests for API
- [ ] Validate input data and manage errors
- [x] Create UI for map points clustering, using Leaflet
- [x] Send points to UI and show them on map
- [x] Zoom in/out to see the difference
